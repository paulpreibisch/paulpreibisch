Hi! I am Paul Preibisch. I have been a Software Developer for over 12 years. The majority of my experience exists within the educational software space. 
I operated as the Lead developer for the Movie English Project (now Globify.com) for 10 years.  
My platform of choice is Laravel.

My most recent development experience was as a Backend Programmer for Vistas Projects Limited, the developers of CurrentSCM - which is an enterprise grade application.
That 13 month contract planted my feet firmly in the world of Laravel where I invested 1800 hours digesting the platform.

I now am continuing on with Laravel, and most specifically Statamic, where I am developing a Rental Booking System.

**CurrentSCM @ Vista Projects Limited**
- Built and maintained a robust API on a multi-tenant enterprise application with over 850 unique endpoints.
- Operated across the full spectrum of the Laravel Framework including areas such as notifications, queues, jobs, middleware, validations, workflows, file systems, pipelines, caching, tasks, and scheduled console commands.
- Implemented a comprehensive Test Platform for 15 Excel Import Templates which leveraged a Data Transfer Object (DTO) to specify information about the Export.
- Leveraged Test-Driven design to create a robust PDF authoring microservice, adhering to SOLID design principles, to consolidate user documents into a single, indexed PDF. 
- Integrated a scalable microservice into CurrentSCM's documentation module, resulting in significant time savings for developers and reduced maintenance costs through enhanced reusability across 9 different exports.
- Enhanced CurrentSCM's invoicing for milestone payments. Overcame challenges with floating point numbers and rounding errors via test-driven development for successful feature delivery.  
- Constructed Json and PDF Reports by pulling data from internal systems.
- Completed 1800+ developer hours of support, responding to Github Features and bugs listed on the issue board.
- Attended daily scrum meetings with the team to align goals and objectives.
- Regularly updated skill set by completing 33 LaraCast lessons and videos about Laravel, Repository management, and General Software development.
