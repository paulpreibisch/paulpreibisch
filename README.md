Hi! I am Paul Preibisch. I am a Ssoftware Developer with 10 years of experience producing production-level code for educational software startups. My platform of choice is Laravel.
I am currently employed as a Backend Programmer at Vistas Projects Limited, and work on their third-party procurement software called CurrentSCM.

**CurrentSCM @ Vista Projects Limited**
- Built and maintained a robust API on a multi-tenant enterprise application with over 850 unique endpoints.
- Operated across the full spectrum of the Laravel Framework including areas such as notifications, queues, jobs, middleware, validations, workflows, file systems, pipelines, caching, tasks, and scheduled console commands.
- Implemented a comprehensive Test Platform for 15 Excel Import Templates which leveraged a Data Transfer Object (DTO) to specify information about the Export.
- Leveraged Test-Driven design to create a robust PDF authoring microservice, adhering to SOLID design principles, to consolidate user documents into a single, indexed PDF. 
- Integrated a scalable microservice into CurrentSCM's documentation module, resulting in significant time savings for developers and reduced maintenance costs through enhanced reusability across 9 different exports.
- Enhanced CurrentSCM's invoicing for milestone payments. Overcame challenges with floating point numbers and rounding errors via test-driven development for successful feature delivery.  
- Constructed Json and PDF Reports by pulling data from internal systems.
- Completed 1800+ developer hours of support, responding to Github Features and bugs listed on the issue board.
- Attended daily scrum meetings with the team to align goals and objectives.
